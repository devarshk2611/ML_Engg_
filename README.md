# ML_Engg

This repository documents my journey toward becoming a **Machine Learning / AI Engineer**.

It is organized into three main sections:

---

## 📘 1. DSA (LeetCode Practice)

**Folder:** `dsa_leetcode/`

- Python implementations of **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- Covers **Easy, Medium, and Hard** LeetCode problems
- Clean, commented, interview-ready solutions

**Goal:** Build strong problem-solving and coding interview skills.

---

## 🐍 2. Python Basics

**Folder:** `python_basics/`

- Core Python fundamentals:
  - Strings, lists, dictionaries
  - File handling
  - Logging and CLI arguments
- Focus on writing **production-quality Python code**

---

## 🤖 3. Machine Learning Projects

**Folder:** `ml_projects/`

### Iris Dataset (Learning Project)
- EDA with Pandas
- Data cleaning & feature engineering
- Logistic Regression
- RandomForest & GradientBoosting with GridSearchCV
- Model comparison plots (Accuracy & Macro-F1)
- Model export (`best_model.joblib`)

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen **coding + algorithms** for SDE interviews
- Build **ML/AI projects** showing end-to-end pipelines
- Prepare for **SDE / ML Engineer / AI Engineer roles**
- Track progress in a structured, professional way

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Python (3.12+)**
- **Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Git / GitHub** for version control
