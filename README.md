# ML_Engg

This repository documents my **journey to becoming an ML/AI Engineer**.

It is organized into three main sections:

## 📘 1. DSA (LeetCode Practice)
- Python implementations of **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- Covers **Easy, Medium, and Hard** LeetCode problems
- Clean, commented code with explanations
- Goal: Build strong problem-solving + coding interview skills  
📂 [dsa_leetcode/](./dsa_leetcode)

## 🐍 2. Python Basics
- Scripts that cover core **Python fundamentals**:
  - Strings, lists, dictionaries, file handling  
  - Logging, CLI arguments
- Prepares for writing production-quality ML/AI code  
📂 [python_basics/](./python_basics)

## 🤖 3. Machine Learning Projects
- **Iris Dataset workflow (Parts 1–5)**:
  - EDA with Pandas
  - Data cleaning & feature engineering
  - Logistic Regression
  - RandomForest & GradientBoosting with GridSearchCV
  - Model comparison plots (Accuracy & Macro-F1)
  - Model export (`best_model.joblib`)  
📂 [ml_projects/](./ml_projects)

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen **coding + algorithms** for SDE interviews
- Build **ML/AI projects** showing end-to-end pipelines
- Prepare for **SDE / ML Engineer / AI Engineer roles**
- Keep track of progress in a structured, professional way

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Python** (3.12+)
- **Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Git/GitHub** for version control
