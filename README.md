# ML_Engg

This repository documents my journey to becoming an **AI/ML Engineer** (and strong SDE candidate).

It is organized into three main sections:

## 1) DSA (LeetCode Practice)
- Python implementations of Data Structures & Algorithms
- Easy / Medium / Hard problems with clean, interview-ready solutions
- Goal: strengthen problem-solving for OAs and technical interviews

Folder: `dsa_leetcode/`

## 2) Python Basics
- Core Python fundamentals (data structures, functions, files, etc.)
- Small scripts focused on writing clean, production-style code

Folder: `python_basics/`

## 3) Machine Learning Projects

### A) Iris (End-to-End ML Workflow)
- EDA + preprocessing (Pandas)
- Feature engineering + scaling
- Baselines + model comparison (Logistic Regression, RandomForest, GradientBoosting)
- Cross-validation + pipelines
- Inference demo

Folder: `ml_projects/iris/`

### B) Customer Churn Prediction (In Progress)
- Part 1: EDA + cleaning
- Part 2: preprocessing + encoding + scaling + SMOTE balancing
- Next: modeling, evaluation, and deployment-style inference

Folder: `ml_projects/customer_churn/`  
Data: `ml_projects/data/customer_churn*.csv`

## Goals
- Build strong **SDE interview skills** (DSA + clean Python)
- Build **ML Engineer-ready projects** (end-to-end pipelines + evaluation + deployment readiness)
- Prepare for **SDE / ML Engineer / AI Engineer** roles in the US

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git/GitHub
