ML_Engg
This repository documents my journey to becoming an ML/AI Engineer.

It is organized into three main sections:

📘 1. DSA (LeetCode Practice)
Python implementations of Data Structures & Algorithms
Covers Easy, Medium, and Hard LeetCode problems
Clean, commented code with explanations
Goal: Build strong problem-solving + coding interview skills
📂 dsa_leetcode/
🐍 2. Python Basics
Scripts that cover core Python fundamentals:
Strings, lists, dictionaries, file handling
Logging, CLI arguments
Prepares for writing production-quality ML/AI code
📂 python_basics/
🤖 3. Machine Learning Projects
Iris Dataset workflow (Parts 1–5):
EDA with Pandas
Data cleaning & feature engineering
Logistic Regression
RandomForest & GradientBoosting with GridSearchCV
Model comparison plots (Accuracy & Macro-F1)
Model export (best_model.joblib)
📂 ml_projects/
🎯 Goals
Strengthen coding + algorithms for SDE interviews
Build ML/AI projects showing end-to-end pipelines
Prepare for SDE / ML Engineer / AI Engineer roles
Keep track of progress in a structured, professional way
🚀 Tech Stack
Python (3.12+)
Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebooks
Git/GitHub for version control
