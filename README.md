# ML_Engg

This repository documents my journey to becoming a **Machine Learning / AI Engineer** while also building strong **Software Development (SDE)** fundamentals.

The focus is on **interview readiness**, **clean engineering practices**, and **end-to-end machine learning projects**.

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections:

---

## 1. DSA (LeetCode Practice)

Python implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms**, focused on technical interviews and online assessments.

- Covers **Easy / Medium / Hard** LeetCode problems
- Clean, readable, interview-ready solutions
- Emphasis on optimal time and space complexity
- Regular practice to build problem-solving intuition

**Folder:** `dsa_leetcode/`

---

## 2. Python Basics

Core Python fundamentals required for writing **production-quality code**.

- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
- Functions and modules
- File handling
- Clean scripting practices

These scripts strengthen the foundation needed for ML, backend, and general software engineering roles.

**Folder:** `python_basics/`

---

## 3. Machine Learning Projects

Hands-on projects demonstrating **end-to-end ML workflows**, from data exploration to inference.

---

### A. Iris Dataset – End-to-End ML Workflow

A complete classical ML pipeline using the Iris dataset.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and scaling
- Baseline models and model comparison:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Cross-validation and pipelines
- Inference demonstration

**Folder:** `ml_projects/iris/`

---

### B. Customer Churn Prediction

A real-world tabular ML problem focused on customer churn.

**Completed:**
- Part 1: EDA and data cleaning
- Part 2: Preprocessing, encoding, scaling, and SMOTE class balancing

**Next Steps:**
- Model training and comparison
- Evaluation using appropriate metrics
- Deployment-style inference pipeline

**Folder:** `ml_projects/customer_churn/`  
**Data:** `ml_projects/data/customer_churn*.csv`

---

### C. BBC News Text Classification (NLP)

An end-to-end NLP project for multi-class text classification.

- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Logistic Regression and Linear SVM
- Macro-F1 based evaluation
- Saved sklearn pipelines
- CLI-based batch inference

**Folder:** `ml_projects/nlp_bbc_news/`

---

## Goals

- Build strong **SDE interview skills** (DSA + clean Python)
- Develop **ML Engineer–ready projects** with complete pipelines
- Practice evaluation, reproducibility, and inference workflows
- Prepare for **SDE / ML Engineer / AI Engineer** roles in the US job market
