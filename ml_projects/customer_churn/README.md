\# Customer Churn Prediction



End-to-end machine learning project to predict customer churn using structured customer data.



---



\## Problem Statement

Customer churn has a direct impact on business revenue.  

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately

identify customers likely to churn.



---



\## Workflow

\- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

\- Data cleaning and preprocessing

\- Feature engineering

\- Handling class imbalance

\- Model training and evaluation

\- Model persistence for inference



---



\## Models Trained

\- \*\*Logistic Regression\*\* (baseline, interpretable)

\- \*\*Random Forest\*\* (non-linear, stronger performance)



---



\## Evaluation Metrics

Due to class imbalance, models were evaluated using:

\- Precision

\- Recall

\- F1-score

\- Confusion Matrix



Random Forest achieved better recall and F1-score, making it more suitable for churn prediction.

\## Key Takeaways

\- Class imbalance significantly impacts churn prediction

\- Tree-based models outperform linear baselines

\- Feature importance helps identify key churn drivers

\- Models were saved for reuse and deployment

\## Tech Stack

\- Python

\- Pandas, NumPy

\- scikit-learn

\- Jupyter Notebooks
