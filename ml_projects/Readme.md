## 📘 Iris Classification (Learning Project)

**Folder:** `iris/`

This project documents my step-by-step learning of the complete machine learning pipeline
using the Iris dataset.

### Covered Topics
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Scaling and transformations
- Logistic Regression
- Tree-based models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Basic inference scripting

**Purpose:**  
Build strong fundamentals in data preparation, modeling, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Customer Churn Prediction (Applied ML Project)

**Folder:** `customer_churn/`  
**Data:** `data/customer_churn*.csv`

This is an end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn.
It is designed to reflect real-world ML engineering workflows.

### Workflow
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and validation
- Feature engineering
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
- Train-test splitting
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Model persistence for deployment

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrate applied machine learning, model lifecycle understanding, and production readiness.
